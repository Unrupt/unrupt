# So no-one's ideas are lost.

Unrupt Demo 1.0 shows automatically pausing or playing back a live VOIP call by means of buffering in the browser triggered by a participant simply starting and stopping speaking**.  

‍**This avoids interruption or disruption from people speaking over each other or backing down, instead each person can speak their thoughts as they arise, and they are played out one after the other, so no-one's ideas are lost.

## **Audio demo**
